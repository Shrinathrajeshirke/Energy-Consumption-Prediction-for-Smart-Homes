# Energy-Consumption-Prediction-for-Smart-Homes

### 1. Problem Definition
Predict energy consumption for smart homes based on various factors (weather, appliance usage, time of day, etc.).
Helps users optimize electricity usage and reduce costs.

### 2. Data Collection
Use an open dataset like UK-Dale or REDD (Residential Energy Disaggregation Dataset).
Or scrape data from sources like weather APIs combined with home energy usage.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values and outliers.
Feature engineering (temperature, humidity, time-based features).
Convert categorical data (if any) into numerical values.
Normalize/scale data for better model performance.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Time series visualization of energy usage patterns.
Correlation analysis (e.g., how temperature impacts energy consumption).

### 5. Model Selection & Training
Baseline Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest.
Advanced Models: SARIMA (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average), LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory).
Train models and compare performance.

### 6. Model Evaluation
Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
Cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

### 7. Deployment
Create a simple FastAPI/Flask API to serve predictions.
Streamlit Dashboard to visualize energy trends & predictions.

### 8. Monitoring with MLflow
Track model performance over different iterations.
Store experiments and compare different models.
